## NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION

## CYBERSECURITY RISK OVERSIGHT SUBCOMMITTEE CHARTER

```
Effective April 24, 2023
```

**I. Purpose**.

The purpose of the Cybersecurity Risk Oversight Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) is
to assist the Business Risk Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”)
of Northern Trust Corporation (the “Corporation”) in discharging its oversight duties with
respect to risks related to cybersecurity inherent in the businesses of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries (collectively, “Northern Trust”).

This Subcommittee Charter shall also govern the Subcommittee as and when it acts as the
Cybersecurity Risk Oversight Subcommittee of the Business Risk Committee of the Board of
Directors of The Northern Trust Company.

**II. Subcommittee Membership**.

The Subcommittee shall consist of three or more directors. The Subcommittee’s
membership shall be such that, in the judgment of the Committee, the Subcommittee shall have
the experience, expertise and judgment necessary to discharge its duties and responsibilities
under this Charter. Each Subcommittee member shall be: (a) an “independent director” under
the Corporation’s Corporate Governance Guidelines; and (b) unless otherwise approved by the
Board, a member of the Committee.

Subcommittee members and the Subcommittee Chairman shall be appointed annually by
the Committee (with the approval of the Board, if any proposed member of the Subcommittee is
not also a member of the Committee) taking into consideration the benefits of a regular rotation
in the membership of the Subcommittee, including the Chairmanship, balancing in each case the
need for fresh perspective with the need for experience and continuity. The Committee may fill
vacancies on the Subcommittee and may remove a member from Subcommittee membership at
any time with or without cause.

**III. Subcommittee Structure and Operations**.

```
A. Meetings.
```

The Subcommittee shall meet in person or by telephone conference, videoconference or
other means of communications permitted under applicable Delaware law as frequently as
necessary to fulfill its duties and responsibilities, but no less frequently than quarterly.
Additional meetings may be held, or actions may be taken by unanimous written consent, as
deemed necessary or appropriate by the Subcommittee Chairman or by any other member of the
Subcommittee. Minutes of each meeting shall be prepared by the Secretary or any Assistant
Secretary of the Corporation or such other person designated by the Subcommittee Chairman as
Acting Secretary of the Subcommittee and, when approved, shall be distributed to all Committee

members, as well as all other members of the Board. The minutes shall document the decisions
of the Subcommittee regarding matters related to its duties and responsibilities.

The Subcommittee may meet with any officer of the Corporation, consultants or advisors
as it may deem necessary or appropriate. The Subcommittee may meet in joint or concurrent
sessions with other committees or subcommittees of the Board from time to time to discuss areas
of common interest and significant matters.

```
B. Quorum; Manner of Acting.
```

A majority of the Subcommittee’s members shall constitute a quorum, and the act of a
majority of the members at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Subcommittee. In the
event of a tie vote on any issue, the Subcommittee Chairman’s vote shall decide the issue. In the
absence or disqualification of a member of the Subcommittee, the members present at any meeting
and not disqualified from voting, whether or not they constitute a quorum, may unanimously
appoint another member of the Committee (or of the Board, with the approval of the Board) who
meets the Subcommittee membership requirements set forth herein to act at the meeting in the
place of any such absent or disqualified member.

```
C. Resources.
```

The Subcommittee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its
duties and responsibilities. In particular, the Committee shall have: (a) direct and unrestricted
access to the Corporation’s management and non-management personnel and all corporate
records; (b) authority to select, retain and terminate the engagement of any consultant in
connection with the performance of its duties and to approve the terms of the engagement,
including the fees to be paid to the consultant; and (c) the authority to obtain advice and
assistance from internal or external legal, accounting or other advisors.

```
D. Delegation of Authority.
```

The Subcommittee may, in its discretion, delegate all or a portion of its duties and
responsibilities to one or more members of the Subcommittee. In addition, the Subcommittee
may, in its discretion and subject to the requirements of applicable law, authorize one or more
officers of the Corporation to take certain actions on its behalf.

**IV. Duties and Responsibilities**.

The Subcommittee’s responsibility is one of oversight. The responsibility for regulatory
compliance and for the management of risks in Northern Trust’s businesses rests with
management of the Corporation. Members of the Subcommittee shall be entitled to rely in good
faith on: (a) the integrity of those persons and organizations within and outside Northern Trust
from which they receive information; and (b) the accuracy of the information provided to the
Subcommittee by such persons or organizations absent actual knowledge to the contrary (which
shall be promptly reported to the Committee and the Board).
