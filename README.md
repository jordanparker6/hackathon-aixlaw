# AI x Law - LLM Hackathon @ Stanford

This repo is a PoC of a AI policy review tool that reviews an internal ICT security policy and provides actionable insights and recommended re-drafting.

With standards, laws and regulations ever changing, a policy documentation notification system that notifies and provides criticism / recommendations is a step towards reducing 3rd party compliance overhead and ensuring responsiveness to regulatory changes.

The developer API for the legal RAG at http://helpmefindlaw.com provides an interesting service for this product, providing a managed service for updates in legal policy via an AI friendly medium. For more information reachout at jordan.parker@helpmefindlaw.com

A demo of the product can be found [here](https://twitter.com/jordanhparker6/status/1705991119354704144)
