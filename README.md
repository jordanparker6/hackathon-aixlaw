                transactions to investors in a transparent fashion;
                    (D) whether generally accepted accounting principles
                specifically result in the consolidation of special
                purpose entities sponsored by an issuer in cases in
                which the issuer has the majority of the risks and
                rewards of the special purpose entity; and
